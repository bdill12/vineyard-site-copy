# Our Grape Varieties

JoBreguen Vineyards is located within the Texas High Plains AVA (American Viticultural Area). The Texas High Plains AVA is the second-largest AVA in the state of Texas, covering 8 million acres of land. According to the Texas Wine and Grape Growers' Association, Texas High Plains vineyards grow over 80% of all wine grapes grown in Texas.

## We grow grapes that make wines we like to drink.
- #### Cabernet Sauvignon
	Our first vines in 2008 were Cabernet Sauvignon. A hardy plant with thick skin, it seemed like a natural fit for the wide open spaces of West Texas. Cabernet Sauvignon gets better as it ages, which made it a perfect start to a life in viticulture.
- #### Muscat Blanc (aka Muscat Canelli)
	In 2010, we discovered a Texas winery with a variety of moscato we all loved, so we planted some Muscat Blanc. This variety of grape is known for small, tight clusters of berries. Perfect for our small, tight cluster of family.
- #### Tempranillo
	In 2013, we added Tempranillo to the vineyard. Tempranillo grapes also have a thick skin, but unlike the Cabernet Sauvignon, they have a neutral profile that blends well with other wines. Just like the grape, we have learned the importance of blending with our winery partners and cooperating with other West Texas wine growers to ensure the quality of our region's product.

We are still looking into the grape variety that makes Grape Kool-AidÂ®.
