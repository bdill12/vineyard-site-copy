# Our Partners in Wine

Texas wine production has risen in recent years, largely due to the rapid growth of West Texas vineyards and West Texas wineries. According to the Texas Wine and Grape Growers' Association, the wine industry now adds over $2 billion of economic value to the state. 

JoBreguen Vineyards is proud to partner with the two largest wineries in the state of Texas, both of which happen to be West Texas wineries.

- ## LLano Estacado
	### Strive for Honor, Evermore
	Llano Estacado Winery, the second-largest winery in the state, was founded in Lubbock in the 1970s and enjoys a close relationship with Texas Tech University. Since most of the Dill family attended Texas Tech, it was both thrilling and fitting when JoBreguen Vineyards' first single-vineyard designation was on a bottle of Llano's 2015 Raider Red Moscato. Long live the Matadors!
- ## Mesa Vineyards
	Mesa Vineyards owns the largest winery in the state of Texas, Ste. Genevieve Winery in Fort Stockton. It was originally founded by The University of Texas System and the profits benefitted the University of Texas System and the Texas A&M University System until 2005, when it was purchased by Mesa Vineyards. Being long-time Red Raider fans, the Dill family has no sour grapes about growing for a winery that benefitted Texas Tech's rivals. Each time they raise a glass, the also make sure to put their Guns Up!
