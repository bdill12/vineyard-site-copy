#### Premium Texas Wine Grapes
**LEARN ABOUT US**

JoBreguen Vineyards is a family-run vineyard near Brownfield, Texas. David and Karla Dill are part of a four-generation legacy of farming in Terry County. Until 2008, the Dills grew primarily cotton and peanuts. In fact, if you wear T-shirts or eat a Snickers bar every now and then, there's a chance the Dill family has already fed and clothed you. But even though eating a Snickers really satisfies, David and Karla still wanted something more. They didn't want to just hand off their harvest to someone else. They wanted to be involved in every part of creating a product. The West Texas wine industry allows them to see the fruits of their labor from seed to shelf. So, since founding JoBreguen Vineyards in 2008, the Dills have grown premium wine grapes for West Texas wineries.
