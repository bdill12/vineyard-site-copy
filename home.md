# Premium Texas Wine Grapes

JoBreguen Vineyards is a family-run vineyard near Brownfield, Texas. David and Karla Dill are part of a four-generation legacy of farming in Terry County, growing primarily cotton and peanuts. However, since founding JoBreguen Vineyards in 2008, the Dills have grown premium wine grapes for West Texas wineries.

### Every wine pairs well with laughter.  
At JoBreguen Vineyards, we help make both.  

##### A good laugh starts in your belly. A good wine ends up there.  

**JoBreguen Vineyards**, owned and operated by D & K Farms in cooperation with 2 Dollar Dill. Proud to be a West Texas vineyard contributing to West Texas wines.
